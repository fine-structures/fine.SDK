The following explores quantifying the products (probabilities) of decay products of
    e + ~e + K8
    
We first confirm other forms the above by comparing Traces of different particle combos:
    e~e + K8:              (0, 42, 12, 266, 120, 2010, 980, 16522, 7536, 141002)

Well, what do you know, the y6 decomposes into (e~e + K4~1) OR (muon + ~muon)
This means an e~e pair can come from: 
    ~π + qyd + (e~e + K4~1), or
    K4 +       (e~e + K4~1)
qyd(4) x e~e(1) x K4~1(6) combos: 24
K4(10) x e~e(1) x K4~1(6) combos: 60

Another decay mode of our v=10 system contains y6 with two neg loops. 
Let's verify that it doesn't have any prime modes or phases that would create lepton pairs:
