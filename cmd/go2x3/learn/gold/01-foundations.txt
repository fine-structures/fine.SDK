Our friend the proton:  p=1,v=3," oBB 2ooA 3    ","","1-2-3",5,13,35,

If we want to get the traces of a 2x3 graph, we can!
proton.Traces():  (5, 13, 35)
proton.Traces(12):  (5, 13, 35, 97, 275, 793, 2315, 6817, 20195, 60073, 179195, 535537)

Or we can access each Traces element easily thanks to python:
    T[0]: 5
    T[1]: 13
    T[2]: 35
    T[3]: 97
    T[4]: 275
    T[5]: 793
    T[6]: 2315
    T[7]: 6817
    T[8]: 20195
    T[9]: 60073
    T[10]: 179195
    T[11]: 535537

Now let's meet GraphStream, allowing us to do more useful things with particle Graph objects.
GraphStream is a chain (pipeline) of Graph operators where Graphs are "pushed" into a stream's inlet and "pulled" from its outlet. 
Adding .Print(label) prints each graph that passes though the stream, printing the given label along with a counter.
Adding .Go() terminates a stream and pulls all the graphs through it:
Hello proton!,000001,p=1,v=3," oBB 2ooA 3    ","","1-2-3",5,13,35,

All edge permutations for a two-vertex photon:
gamma.PermuteEdgeSigns,000001,p=1,v=2,"2OOO 2    ","","1---2",0,18,
gamma.PermuteEdgeSigns,000002,p=1,v=2,"2OOO 2  _ ","","1--~2",0,2,
gamma.PermuteEdgeSigns,000003,p=1,v=2,"2OOO 2 __ ","","1-~~2",0,2,
gamma.PermuteEdgeSigns,000004,p=1,v=2,"2OOO 2___ ","","1~~~2",0,18,

For each particle that PermuteEdgeSigns() takes in, it sends out all possible permutations of positive and negative edges:

Most graphs can be expressed identically in multiple ways.
Consider various equivalent ways to label a neutron:
neutron[a]:  p=1,v=4," BBC 2oOA  ooA 4    ","","1-2-3-1-4",4,14,34,98,
neutron[b]:  p=1,v=4," BBC 2oOA  ooA 4    ","","1-2-3-1 2-4",4,14,34,98,
neutron[c]:  p=1,v=4," BBC 2oOA  ooA 4    ","","3-4 2-3-1-2",4,14,34,98,

EnumPureParticles() runs an algorithm that generates all possible valid particles having only positive loops and edges.
Let's generate from up to v=3:
out[10],000001,p=1,v=1," ooo      ","","1",3,
out[10],000002,p=1,v=2,"2ooO 2    ","","1-2",4,10,
out[10],000003,p=1,v=2,"2oOO 2    ","","1=2",2,10,
